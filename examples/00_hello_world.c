/* 00_hello_world.c
 * 
 * C version of the classic "Hello World!" program, for reference.
 * During the course we will write mostly C-style code, with a few C++ features when appropriate
 * (NB: Unless discussing specifically differences between the two, I will probably
 *  use C and C++ interchangeably)
